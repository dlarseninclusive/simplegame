would pygame be better, or Unity?

Edit
To determine whether Pygame or Unity would be better for your game idea, let's consider the pros and cons of each in relation to your specific requirements:


Pygame vs Unity Comparison for Horror RTS Game
Click to open document
Based on this comparison, I would recommend Unity for your project. Here's why:

RTS Mechanics: Unity has better built-in support for handling multiple units, pathfinding, and complex interactions, which are crucial for RTS gameplay.
Scale: Your game involves open maps and dungeon transitions. Unity can handle larger, more complex environments more efficiently.
Procedural Generation: While possible in both, Unity has more robust tools and community resources for procedural generation.
Atmosphere: For a horror game, Unity's superior graphics capabilities, lighting systems, and particle effects will help create a more immersive and creepy atmosphere.
Future-proofing: If you decide to add more complex features or even transition to 3D later, Unity will accommodate this more easily.
Asset Store: Unity's asset store has many pre-made tools for inventory systems, dialog trees, and quest management, which could significantly speed up your development process.
While Pygame is excellent for certain types of games, the scope and complexity of your horror RTS idea align better with Unity's capabilities. The learning curve might be steeper initially, but it will likely save you time and effort in the long run, especially when implementing more complex systems.

what systems should I start with?

Edit
When starting to develop your horror RTS game in Unity, it's best to focus on core systems that will form the foundation of your gameplay. Here's a suggested order of systems to implement, starting with the most fundamental:


Core Systems for Horror RTS Game in Unity
Click to open document
To get started, I recommend focusing on the first four systems: Character Controller, Camera System, Map Generation, and Character Selection and Command System. These will give you a solid foundation to build upon.

Character Controller System: Start by creating a basic character prefab and script for movement. Implement functions for moving in four directions using Unity's built-in input system. Once you have a single character moving, you can expand this to handle multiple characters.
Camera System: Create a camera that follows the character(s). Use Unity's Cinemachine package for easier camera control and smooth movements. Implement basic zoom and pan functionality to allow players to survey the map.
Map Generation System: Begin with Unity's Tilemap system to create simple, static levels. Once you're comfortable with this, start implementing procedural generation. Start simple - perhaps randomly placing rooms and connecting them with corridors.
Character Selection and Command System: Implement click-to-select functionality for your characters. Use Unity's NavMesh system for basic pathfinding. Create a simple UI indicator to show which character(s) are currently selected.
By focusing on these core systems first, you'll have a playable prototype that you can then expand upon with the more complex systems like inventory, dialog, and quests.

Would you like me to provide more detailed guidance on implementing any of these initial systems? Or do you have a specific aspect you'd like to start with?

How can I make this more open world, and still keep much of the loop

Edit
To make "Echoes of the Abyss: Convergence" more open-world while maintaining the core of the game loop, we can adapt the structure to allow for more player-driven exploration and non-linear progression. Here's how we can modify our approach:


Open World Game Loop for Echoes of the Abyss: Convergence
Click to open document
To successfully implement this open-world approach while maintaining the essence of the original game loop, consider the following:

Scalable Difficulty: Implement a system that scales enemy difficulty and mission complexity based on the team's current level and equipment. This allows players to tackle content in any order while maintaining challenge.
Story Gating: While allowing for open exploration, gate certain areas or major story developments behind key missions or character progressions. This ensures that the narrative remains coherent regardless of the order in which players approach content.
Dynamic Mission Generation: Create a system that generates side missions and events based on the player's location, progress, and world state. This keeps the open world feeling alive and responsive.
Integrated Storytelling: Spread narrative elements throughout the open world via environmental storytelling, collectibles, and NPC interactions. This rewards exploration while building the game's atmosphere.
Flexible Base System: Instead of a single safe house, provide multiple outposts or safehouses throughout the world. Players can use these for quick resource management and minor upgrades without breaking the open-world immersion.
Persistent World State: Ensure that player actions have visible impacts on the world, such as cleared areas becoming safer or neglected regions seeing increased enemy activity.
Fast Travel System: To mitigate potential tedium in a larger world, implement a fast travel system that fits the game's lore (e.g., mystical portals or a network of secret tunnels).
Emergent Gameplay: Design systems that create unscripted moments, such as dynamic weather affecting enemy behavior or random supernatural events that can occur during exploration.
Adaptive UI and Guidance: Provide players with tools to track multiple objectives, discover points of interest, and manage their progress without feeling overwhelmed in the open world.
By implementing these elements, you can create an open-world experience that maintains the strategic depth and horror atmosphere of the original concept while offering players more freedom and emergent gameplay opportunities.
